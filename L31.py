#After we ran the code an image came on the screen in the color that we chose and moved accross the screen
#In the first line you import the function
#fred.color assigns a color to fred
#fred.forward makes the turtle move to the right
#fred.right makes the turtle turn by x degrees
#changing the fred.right argument to 90 made the turtle turn at a right angle
